## Technologies :computer:

 1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 2. [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
 3. [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)

## Why Redux and Redux-Saga
**Redux** is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments and are easy to test. While it's mostly **used** as a state management tool with React, you can **use** it with any other JavaScript framework or library.

**redux**-**saga** is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.
Where as **redux**-**saga** is a library that mainly focuses on easy handling of application side effects and more efficient for execution.
